Magic 8-Ball for Seeeduino Film &amp; OLED Frame

I've had a Seeeduino Film and the accompanying OLED Frame for a while and figured it was time to put it to use, thus the Magic 8-Ball was created!

Two versions of the code is available - 

Magic_8_Ball.ino - This utilises the 'sleep' button on the film itself to 'ask' the question.

Magic_8_Ball_LED_BTN.ino - The 'ask' button is now located off-board as well as a status light. I've used an illuminated button. It glows RED when ready to ask and goes off while showing the answer.
